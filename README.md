# Photogrammetry Lab

Welcome to the Photogrammetry Laboratory Repository! Here you'll find a collection of elaborate lab reports that I had to submit for the Photogrammetry course at Politecnico di Milano, covering a diverse range of topics and hands-on activities. Let's take a closer look at what each lab entails.

## Laboratory Activities

### 1. Digital camera calibration & 3D modelling of a simple object
The laboratory aimed to create a precise 3D model of a Rubikâ€™s cube using Photomodeler software. Emphasizing the significance of camera calibration, photos were taken with a Nikon D3100, ensuring consistent parameters. Despite challenges like low-quality lighting, the calibration process revealed a total error exceeding the desired value. Outlier rejection improved the error, but subpar conditions prompted an accuracy test. The cube's homologous points were collimated, leading to a successful 3D model creation with satisfactory edge measurements, albeit challenges in area computations. The achieved Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) aligned closely with the caliper's accuracy.
